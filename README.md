A learning C++ Game Of Life
===========================

This was a challenge for an hour after a recent C++ course I participated in.

Once as a kid I saw a game of life game and thought not much of it, but now writing one I figure it was a great learning experience.

C++ Learning benefits/use

* Usage of C++ class
* Usage of operator overloads +=
* Usage of operator construction and destruction
* Highlight simplicity of good OO design in main functions.

This is just a simple script and I'm certain there are lots of enhancements and ways to do it. The discussion around it is the primary purpose of this.

### Making/Building

Tested on OSX/Ubuntu with the xcode/build_tools installed.

"make" should build this one

Should also work on windows, however the system call to clear the screen is "cls" not "clear".

Cheers
